        <p>Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! You lived before you met me?! I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.</p>
        <p>Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? Take me to your leader! I'll get my kit! You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?</p>
        <p>I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.</p>

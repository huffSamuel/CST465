        <h1>And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?</h1>
        <p>WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. When will that be? Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?</p>
        <p>Bender, you risked your life to save me! That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</p>
        <h2>Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?</h2>
        <p>Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. Shinier than yours, meatbag. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! File not found. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!</p>
        <p>Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. She also liked to shut up! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.</p>
        <h3>Ow, my spirit!</h3>
        <p>Large bet on myself in round one. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.</p>
        <p>Take me to your leader! Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!</p>
        <p>Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.</p>
